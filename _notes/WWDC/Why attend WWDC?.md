### Attending WWDC

My experience at WWDC was amazing. I spoke with so many passionate and community driven people in iOS field. Everyone was excited to help one another along their journey, answering any question. People talked about personal development, monetization, and technologies. I even had someone walk me through using the Developer's Application to view WWDC Sessions. See [[Why view "New to WWDC?" Sessions]]
