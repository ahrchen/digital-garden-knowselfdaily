title: New to WWDC
---

Upon downloading the [Developer Application](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958) at WWDC, I found WWDC to be more accessible. I clicked around and found a ["New to WWDC?"](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/topics/coding-design-essentials/). Here I began my dive into WWDC sessions. It was a breathe of new APIs available for developers were introduced. With each API, I got a sense of where I could dive deeper and develop applications. 

Go check it out and have fun ðŸš€
