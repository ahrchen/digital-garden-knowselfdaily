title: SwiftUI ScrollView
---

### Main Idea
Scroll views can scroll horizontally, vertically, or in both directions, and you can also control whether the system should show scroll indicators next to them – those are the little scroll bars that appear to give users a sense of how big the content is. When we place views inside scroll views, they automatically figure out the size of that content so users can scroll from one edge to the other.


```swift
struct CustomText: View {
    let text: String
    
    var body: some View {
        Text(text)
    }
    
    init(_ text: String) {
        print("Creating a new CustomText")
        self.text = text
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    
    var body: some View {
        
        ScrollView(.horizontal) {
            LazyHStack(spacing: 10) {
                ForEach(0..<100) {
                    CustomText("Item \($0)")
                        .font(.title)
                }
            }
            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
        }
       
    }
}

```
