### [Fundamental Design VisionOS](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10072/)

This video goes over the fundamentals of designing for VisionOS. Like, why Apple Music App, Photo App, and Freeform App looks the way it does?

#### Familiar

- Windows
    - Design a familiar experience for users
- Sizing 
    - Make your window dynamic 
    - One key moment that makes the experience special 
- Point
    - Everything scales with points
    - For more see [Design for spatial user interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10076)

#### Human-Centered

- Field of View 
    - Center it to the person
    - Use a wide window
- Ergonomics 
    - Line of sight
    - Away from people
    - Anchored in things in space
- Movement
    - Requires minimal movement for accessibility

#### Dimensional

- Space
    - Design for all sized spaces ( Don't quite know what this means)
    - See the Video Playback Application
- Depth
    - Far Away -> Interact at a distince
    - Nearby -> Interact with the object
    - Heirarchy
        - Close in proximity, Signals Importance
            - Subtle depth is enough
        - Shadow, Signals weight of object
        - Emit Light, Signals weight of object
- Scale
    - Small, Light Weight and Personal
    - Big immersion 
    - Shopping 1:1 Scale

#### Immersive

- Spectrum
    - Shared Space <-> Dimming <-> Full Space 
    - Start in Shared Space to give people control over where they want to be 
- Essential Tips
    - Guide People's focus with continuity and soft edges 
    - Blend the app with people's spaces
- Comfort(Fimilar)
    - Subtle Motions/Signals [Design considerations for vision and motion](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10078)
        - Clouds in the sky
        - Ripples in the water
        - Theater Light from Screen 
    - Ease in out of spectrum
    - Create atmosphere with sound [Explore immersive sound design](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10271)

#### Authentic
- Allow People to Welcome AR Experience into Their Space
- Find key moments using depth and scale to make a special experience that can only be experienced with visionOS
