### Step Seven VisionOS

Next Apple recommends more tools that we learn a bit  about like Unity and App Store Connect. Here we learn about creating apps using Unity and deploying apps. I believe these will be great for those who are really familar with Unity. But this is very useful to expand your knowledge base in terms of developing for VisionOS and learn the advantages and disadvantage between using Unity and Reality Composer Pro. 

"App Store Connect will provide the tools you need to manage, test, and deploy your visionOS apps on the App Store. We’ll share basics and best practices for deploying your first spatial computing app, adding support for visionOS to an existing app, and managing compatibility. We’ll also show you how TestFlight for visionOS lets you test your apps and collect valuable feedback as you iterate."
