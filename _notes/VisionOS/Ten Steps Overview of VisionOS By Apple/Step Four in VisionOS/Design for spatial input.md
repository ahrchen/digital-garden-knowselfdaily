This video provides several key tips on great interactions for eyes and hands.

#### Eyes 2:22

- Every element in UI reacts to your eyes.
    - Comfortable
        - Most eye comfort to look in the center.
            - Minimize neck and body movement
            - Sides for controls that don't use often
        
        - Eyes focus on one depth at a time, swapping depth cause eye strain
            - Keep interactive content at the same depth
                - Eyes don't have to adapt to new distance 
    - Easy to use
        - Shape guide out attention to the middle of shapes
            - Use rounded shapes not sharp, because we look to the edge of sharp object
            - Center the gylphs of the rounded shapes
        - Size of elements
            - 60pts by 60pts spacing between elements
                - combining size and spacing
        - Scale your elements
            - Use dynamic scale: smaller closer and larger further, so your eyes can control 
            - fixed scale: same size closer and further
        - Keep UI oriented to the viewer
