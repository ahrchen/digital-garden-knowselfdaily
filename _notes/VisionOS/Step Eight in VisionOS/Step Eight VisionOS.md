### Step Eight VisionOS

Next Apple recommends that we learn a bit more about App Store Connent and TestFlight. We want to be able to deploy our app to the world and collect feedback. Then we will look into creating games in visionOS
```
App Store Connect will provide the tools you need to manage, test, and deploy your visionOS apps on the App Store. We’ll share basics and best practices for deploying your first spatial computing app, adding support for visionOS to an existing app, and managing compatibility. We’ll also show you how TestFlight for visionOS lets you test your apps and collect valuable feedback as you iterate.
