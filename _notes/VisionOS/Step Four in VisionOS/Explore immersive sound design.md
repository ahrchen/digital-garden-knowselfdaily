This video provides several key tips on using sound for spatial computing. Discover how you can use sound to enhance the experience of your visionOS apps and games. Learn how Apple designers select sounds and build soundscapes to create textural, immersive experiences. We'll share how you can enrich basic interactions in your app with sound when you place audio cues spatially, vary repetitive sounds, and build moments of sonic delight into your app.


#### Spatial Audio

- Locate iPhone in my room
    - loud volume and reverbration means that I am closer to device


#### Interaction sounds

- Add sound to each interaction gives user familiarity and confidence
    - vitual keyboard
        - sound confirms your action
        - randomize a common sound, to make it more natural
    - Photos - subtle fit with system sound
        - selecting photo
        - transition 2D -> 3D
        - browsing photos
    

#### Immersive apps

- Mount hood 
    - how accurate should it be to the environment
       
        - doesn't need to be accurate, sound should compliment visual
        - high sensative directional recordings in quiet area.
    - Mix it
        - frogs, birds, cricket 
            - placed in foreground and midground
            - place many left and right, reduce sounds for distance
            - place a few left and right, randomize a collection of frog and location

        - ambient noise
            - background, loop continuously
            - wind noise in the background

- Best practice
    - Radomization
    - Placement
    - Volume

- Animation is the source of the sound. 
    - Hello
        - ambient echo
        - source from animated hello
