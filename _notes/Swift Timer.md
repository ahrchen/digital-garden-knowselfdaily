title: Swift Timer
---

### Main Idea

We use the timer class to trigger events repeatedly.
```swift

struct ContentView: View {
    
    let timer = Timer.publish(every: 1, tolerance: 0.5, on: .main, in: .common).autoconnect()
    @State private var counter = 0
    
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello World")
            .onReceive(timer) { time in
                if self.counter == 5 {
                    self.timer.upstream.connect().cancel()
                } else {
                    print("The time is now \(time)")
                }
                
                self.counter += 1
            }
    }
}

```
