title: Swift Animations Types
---

### Main Idea

In SwiftUI, the simplest type of animation is an implicit one: we tell our views ahead of time “if someone wants to animate you, here’s how you should respond”, and nothing more. SwiftUI will then take care of making sure any changes that do occur follow the animation you requested. In practice this makes animation trivial – it literally could not be any easier.

These binding animations effectively turn the tables on implicit animations: rather than setting the animation on a view and implicitly animating it with a state change, we now set nothing on the view and explicitly animate it with a state change. In the former, the state change has no idea it will trigger an animation, and in the latter the view has no idea it will be animated – both work and both are important.

Now, though, we’re being explicit that we want an animation to occur when some arbitrary state change occurs: it’s not attached to a binding, and it’s not attached to a view, it’s just us explicitly asking for a particular animation to occur because of a state change.

```swift

// Implicit Animations

struct ContentView: View {
    
    @State private var animationAmount = 1.0
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("Tap Me") {
           animationAmount += 1
        }
        .padding(50)
        .background(.red)
        .foregroundColor(.white)
        .clipShape(Circle())
        .scaleEffect(animationAmount)
        .blur(radius: (animationAmount - 1) * 3)
        .animation(.default, value: animationAmount)
        
    }
}

// Binding Animations

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var animationAmount = 1.0

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Stepper("Scale amount", value: $animationAmount.animation(), in: 1...10)

            Spacer()

            Button("Tap Me") {
                animationAmount += 1
            }
            .padding(40)
            .background(.red)
            .foregroundColor(.white)
            .clipShape(Circle())
            .scaleEffect(animationAmount)
        }
    }
}

// Spinning coin (Explicit Animations)
struct ContentView: View {   
    @State private var animationAmount = 0.0
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("Tap Me") {
            withAnimation {
                animationAmount += 360
            }
        }
        .padding(50)
        .background(.red)
        .foregroundColor(.white)
        .clipShape(Circle())
        .rotation3DEffect(.degrees(animationAmount), axis: (x: 0, y: 1, z: 0))
    }
}


```
